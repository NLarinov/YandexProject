# Welcome

_This is my Yandex golang project_

### Init:

_to run server:_ 
```
cd YandexProject
go run main.go
```

code has all requireable comments about functions and structures

### Pages:

* new.html (http://localhost:8000) expression input
* listExp.html (http://localhost:8000/list-ex) list of expressions

to add time (addDuration) click on "ADD TIME" on listExp.html;
list of expressions shows all required data (working goroutines, id's, e.t.c);
to see updating data you have to refresh page

### Commands:
input on new.html:
```
1+2+3
```
```
1*2+4*10*12345312
```
```
1+2+3/5*(10+9)/3
```

#### P.S.
if you kill one calculating server, it's operation status will stay
"proceeding", so you need to restart server to rerun expression
